## Customer-Segmentation-RFM-Analysis
# Data Preprocessing: 
Import the dataset and perform necessary data preprocessing steps, including data cleaning, handling missing values, and converting data types if needed.Calculate the RFM metrics for each customer. Assign RFM scores to each customer based on their quartiles (or custom-defined 
bins). You can use quartiles (1 to 4) or custom scores (e.g., 1 to 5) for each RFM 
metric. Combine the RFM scores to create a single RFM score for each customer.
